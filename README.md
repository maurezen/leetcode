# leetcode

plug into your leetcode and pray.

doesn't have run harness, doesn't have test cases, just code blobs to be pasted in the leetcode editor.

some problems have several similarly named methods, usually self-descriptive names for different approaches are provided. the most sophisticated approach is kept as a default (same method name as over at leetcode)
